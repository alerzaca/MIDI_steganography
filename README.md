# MIDI Steganography
Audio steganography - using shifts in MIDI quantization as a message carrier


This repository has not been built yet, but sooner or later it will contain a full description and hopefully working programs that perform encoding and decoding messages in midi files.

The algorithms used here are not inspired by any specific existing audio steganography algorithms, but it requires further research whether such a method has ever been invented and/or implemented.

## Software used
- [Ableton 11 Live](https://www.ableton.com) for midi tracks visualisation
- [MuseScore 4](https://musescore.org) for scores
- any code editor

All sheet music used for testing is under a CC BY or CC0 license and is free to share and modify.

## To do list
- [ ] Research existing papers/articles about audio steganography methods
- [ ] Write a description of the general idea
- [ ] Create program templates
- [ ] Implement algorithms in <b>python</b>
- [ ] Rebuild finall project in <b>C++</b> (hopefully)
