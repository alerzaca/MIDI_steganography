# MIDI Steganography
Audio steganography - using shifts in MIDI quantization as a message carrier


This repository has not been built yet, but sooner or later it will contain a full description and hopefully working programs that perform encoding and decoding messages in midi files.

The algorithms used here are not inspired by any specific existing audio steganography algorithms, but it requires further research whether such a method has ever been invented and/or implemented.

## To do list
- [ ] Research for existing papers/articles about audio steganography methods
- [ ] Write a description of the general idea
- [ ] Create program templates
- [ ] Implement algorithms in <b>python</b>
- [ ] Rebuild finall project in <b>C++</b> (hopefully)
